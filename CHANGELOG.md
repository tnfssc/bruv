# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Save `/fast` globally for future sessions and agents, with a one-time cost confirmation.
- Add `/usage` for ChatGPT plan limits, credits, and session usage, with footer status and limit warnings.

## 1.0.0

- Rewrite bruv as a Pi package installed with `pi install`.
- Remove voice, remote access, the web UI, the T3 Claude connector, history search, the old compaction modes, the compiled binary, and the updater.
- Start jobs and agents in the background, wait inside tools, and deliver work left running with the next message. Esc or Stop ends the run and its background work.
- Carry over goals, fast mode, Codex compaction, and questions that let work continue while the user answers.
